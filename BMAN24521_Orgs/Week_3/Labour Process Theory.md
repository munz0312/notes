Sources of conflict between employers and employees:
- Salary
- Hours worked
- Working conditions

"Structured antagonism" - inherent conflicts or tensions within a social structure.

The labour process perspective suggests that managerial action is chiefly motivated by capital-labour relations, by strategies of employers and their agents to try and control and stabilise the 'unruly' element/factor of production, namely living labour.

Capitalism is based upon the the purchase and sale of labour power.
The final price of goods/service is more than the cost of labour and other inputs = valorisation (creation of surplus value).

General conditions of work and employment apply within capitalist society:
- Workers are 'free'
- Workers can only survive by selling their labour
- The purpose of work is expansion of capital belonging to the employer - not individual/social benefits *per se*

Key themes - **power, control, exploitation and inequality**

What is being bought by the employers?
- Capacity to work
- Physical, mental (and emotional) capabilities
- Latent skills, knowledge and expertise
- Intangibles - 'commitment, loyalty, drive, passion, energy'
- Higher level objectives: customer/client satisfaction?

The management challenge:
- Deal with the indeterminate nature of the employment contract
- Increase output, harness skills and capabilities
- Reduce costs and increase labour productivity
- Need workers to be both disposable and dependable *Hyman 1987*

## Controlling the labour process

### Deskill and divide

- Study the constituent elements of the labour process - time & motion studies
- Production subdivided into smaller, specialised tasks in an attempt to improve productivity and efficiency - Taylor's Scientific management
- Requires less skill from individuals - jobs relate to the performance of carrying out very specific tasks, rather than production process
- Destroys 'craft' under semi-autonomous control of worker and brings it under managerial control.

### Mechanisation/Digitisation

- Expansion of machinery from 19$^{th}$ century onwards
- Introduction of machinery to create 'factory hands', rather than 'cunning workmen' *A. Ure cited in Thompson, 1989:47*
- Further reduced skill requirements - automation/AI replacement of white collar jobs *Prug and Bilic, 2021*
- Undermined control and power of labour
- Prolonged working day
- Introduction of assembly lines: physically increase pace of work, introduce new shifts and work patterns to maximise output *Beynon, 1973 Working for Ford*

### Technological surveillance
- Tachometers, GPS systems - drivers/mobile workers
- Call centres - recording and analysing calls for performance metrics, monitoring CCTV footage
- Digital Taylorism - e-monitoring, text messages/prompts, and augmented reality goggles in Amazon warehouses

### Market control
- Employers aim for "flexibility" (numerical & functional) to minimise fixed costs and respond to changing demand
- Greater competition between workers for jobs and hours
- Results in insecure or "precarious" work - short term and contingent contracts, casualisation, agency work, gig work - not guaranteed any hours. "Zero hour contracts".
- Link individual jobs to corporate outcomes/performance targets - performance related pay, piece rate systems (e.g. pay per drop)

There is a fight for power and control in the employer-employee relationship.
employers want to squeeze as much profit as they can from employees
employees want
