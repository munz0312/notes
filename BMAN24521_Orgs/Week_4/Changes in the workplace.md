## Over the past 50 years

### Feminisation 
- Rapid expansion of female participation after WWII
- Liberalisation and changing social norms
- Increasing protections for women
- But also a source of cheap labour, less likely to protest working conditions
- Falling real wages means two incomes needed
### Flexibilisation
 - Rise of 'non-standard' work
- Reflects worker preferences for work routines that fit around other demands and schedules - still more common for women
- But also suits employer demands to match stocks of labour with variable demand - particularly in service sector
What kind of flexibility? 1/3 of employers do not offer flexible working conditions
### Fragmentation
- Break down of production processes in smaller activities
- Core vs peripheral workfoce/activities
- Outsource and Off shoring
- Flexible production systems
### Financialisation
- **Financial returns** from mergers and acquisitions
- **Globalisation** - greater financial integration and capital flows across worlds markets - **Weakened Labour**
- **Competition between countries** for investment - potential downward pressure on pay and conditions
- **Offshoring and outsourcing** - gradually moving from lower skill to higher skill jobs, impacts the working class in the West.
## Future trends
### Technological change
Automation, AI, digitisation

From WEF 2025 "Future of Jobs": 

"Given these evolving skill demands, the scale of workforce upskilling and reskilling expected to be needed remains significant: if the worldâ€™s workforce was made up of 100 people, 59 would need training by 2030. Of these, employers foresee that 29 could be upskilled in their current roles and 19 could be upskilled and re-deployed elsewhere within their organization. However, 11 would be unlikely to receive the reskilling or upskilling needed, leaving their employment prospects increasingly at risk"
### Geoeconomic Fragmentation
Shifts in global trade, supply chains and regional alliances
### Economic Uncertainty
Inflation, recession, evolving financial systems
### Demographic Shifts
Aging populations, migration trends and changing workforce dynamics
### Green Transition
Sustainability, renewable energy, and eco-conscious innovation
