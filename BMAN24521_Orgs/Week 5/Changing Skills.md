- Understand the importance, definitions and meaning of skill
- Evaluate different conceptualisations of skill and their implications
- Assess the problems with skills and their measurement, especially in reference to soft skill and employee selection tools
- Examine implications for the employment relationship

## Importance of Skills
- Society - progress of a country and its people
- Organisations - competitive advantage, survival, achieving goals - through the HR function of training and development
- Individuals - career prospects, wages, social status, life chances, personal development

### Skill in the Person
- Skill is generally considered to be a quality possessed by the individual and acquired through education, training and experience
- Wage levels usually determined by skills
- Human capital approach: responsibility for skill development is on the individual - meritocracy
- But:
	- Does not account for inequality of opportunity between individual/groups
	- No guarantee that skills are 'needed'
	- Employers looking for **signals of social class** or 'polish' (where your degree is from).

### Skill in the Job
- Jobs are skilled or unskilled (rather than people)
- Wage levels and status based on demands of tasks/role
	- Technical specialisms, seniority, responsibility, danger/discomfort
- Complexity of tasks or extent of discretion
	- Complexity - four specific groups of job skills (verbal, physical, problem solving, planning)
	- Discretion - the choice over how the job is done, the closeness of supervision, the freedom to decide how hard to work
	- Formally measured through job evaluation

### Skill in the Setting
- Wage levels are shaped by wider social norms - the worth of jobs/skills
- Shaped by historic customs, prejudices and idealogies - so cannot be reduced to natural economic laws
- Skill in the setting can change over time - formal recognition of 'natural' and soft skills

## Problematic skills
- Lack of clarity of skills - leads to employers exploiting and discriminating
- Soft skills are difficult to accurately measure
- Gender - 'Feminine' skills are undervalued
- Organisation change - core/peripheral workers, change in industry - tech and service
- Supply and demand: 50% of the population are overqualified - 25% of jobs don't require a university education.

### Implications for the Employment Relationship
- Fair and accurate employee selection
- Upskilling: Long term investment in staff - training and development
- Opportunities in the organisation, certifications, job rotations - Growth
- Internal Labour Markets to independence of workers - Workforce Planning and Performance Management and Compensation
