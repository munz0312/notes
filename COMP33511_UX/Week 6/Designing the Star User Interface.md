"The interface adheres rigorously to a small set of design principles"
This makes the system "seem familiar and friendly, simplify the human-machine interaction, unify the nearly two dozen functional areas of Star, and allow user experience in one area to apply in others."

"modeled after the experiemental Xerox Alto computer"

It has a mouse. "Fitts's Law" device - after some practice you can point with a mouse as quickly and as easily as with your finger. The cursor stays where you left it, doesn't have to picked up like a pen. It has buttons on it to control programs.

Main goals:
- Familiar user's conceptual model
- Seeing and pointing vs remembering and typing
- What you see is what you get
- Universal commands
- Consistency
- Simplicity
- Modeless interaction
- User tailorability

## Familiar user's conceptual model 
The set of concepts a person gradually acquires to explain the behaviour of the system, whether it be a computer system, a physical system or a hypothetical system. This step of deciding which model is preferable for users of the system is often neglected or done poorly. 

Star chose the metaphor of a physical office. They created the digital counterparts to the physical objects found in an office - paper, folders, file cabinets, mail boxes.

Interacting with these objects is also designed to be easy and familiar. Documents would have picture representations which you could select and move, copy or delete. This is the equivalent of picking up a piece of paper and doing something with it.

You could take the paper and move it to the picture of the outbasket to send it, then when you receive mail, you can see it in the inbasket. Simple and familiar.

The desktop is the first thing that user's see. The view resembles the top of an office desk, together with furniture and equipment. The objects such as documents, folders, file drawers, in/out-baskets are displayed as icons for the user to click on to deal with that particular function.

Not everything can be made into a digital equivalent - records processing is done with a different model. Record file is a collection of fields, a record can be displayed as a row in a table, displaying its fields. Querying can be done by filling in a blank record with the predicates that describe the desired records. Different models should not overlap.

## Seeing and pointing
Systems which make all the relevant tasks visibles are generally less of a burden on the memory due to not needing to remember keybinds and shortcuts. Invoking commands from keybindings can be frustrating because trying to do an action, then have nothing visible happen is bad. People may repeatedly try to invoke a command and there could be several reasons why nothing happens.

Progressive disclosure - hiding complexity until it is needed.

## WYSIWYG
What you see is what you get refers to when the display screen portrays an accurate rendition of the printed page. In a document this could mean accurately portraying fonts, line spacing and other characteristics.

This is easier than using a document compiler since you can examine the appearance and make changes until it looks right.

There were some limitations - hardware limitations mostly because some fonts and font sizes were difficult to represent using a 72 DPI display (not enough dots to be recognisable) so a magnifying tool was developed for viewing this.

## Universal Commands
