UX specialists should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for evaluation on human subjecs in their own counties as well as international requirements where applicable.

The need for ethics has stemmed from history. In scientific, medical and empirical communities in general, the people in positions of power imposed their will on communities of people at the lower levels. This lead to abuses of human 'subjects'.

Participant vs subject - looking at the definitions, a subject has an experiment made *upon* them, where as a participant *shares* in the experimental process.
Additionally, the more a human participant feels like a subject, the more they tend to agree with the evaluator - bias.

And so, we often see that evaluators convey respect and gratitude towards the participants to better see them as equals.

Ethics refers to morals. A term used to describe the behaviour or aspects of the human character that is either good or bad, right or wrong, good or evil.

Obviously UX ethics are not the same as medical ethics for example - no invasive procedures are being done on participants. 

Its more about good evaluation methodologies, being honest about evaluation/results. It ensures due diligence and duty of care to participants
