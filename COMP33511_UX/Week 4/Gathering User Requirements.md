Requirements engineering is the systematic process for identifying, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs.
Ensures the final product meets its purpose and user expectations.

Requirements should be complete, accurate, consistent and feasible.

Types of requirements:
- **Customer requirements** – user/stakeholder needs
- **Structural requirements** – system architecture
- **Behavioural requirements** – system responses to inputs
- **Functional requirements** – what the system _does_
- **Non-functional requirements** – qualities like usability, reliability, accessibility
- **Performance requirements** – speed, capacity, efficiency
- **Design requirements** – constraints on how it’s built
- **Derived / Allocated requirements** – inferred or assigned to components

OADI Framework (Observation - Analysis - Discussion - Interpretation)

Digital Phenotyping 
![[Pasted image 20251022171948.png]]
It is the moment-by-moment quanitification of human behaviour using data from personal digital devices (mainly smartphones)

Active and Passive data is collected and its intertwined with analysis.

UCD is User Centred Design (coined by Donald Norman, 1980s)
It places the user at the centre of system design to ensure that the product meets actual user needs. It needs extensive user consultation. 

Universal Usability
Developed by Ben Shneiderman (1990s)
Extends UCD to ensure systems are usable by everyone - focusing on inclusivity, 
accessibility, and learnability

Functional requirements are those which are specific to the development/system whilst non-function requirements relate to good user experience practice in general. Usability for example is non-functional.

When requirements are extracted from users, this then has to be communicated to the software engineers which is where some information can be lost.

We may model requirements using well known methodologies such as UML Use Case Diagrams, user task analysis or any general use case diagrams. 

Post it notes are quite useful because anyone can write on them them stick them on a board. They can be easily added, removed, changed, grouped etc... Overall a good way of representing information.

Different time scales call for different methods of analysis.

6 months - this is enough time for observation work - you observe the daily lives of participants (informants) and conduct very informal interviews with them, trying to understand their behaviour.

6 weeks - group interviews, focus groups, standard interviews. Social processes - informal conversations with people held at events.

Lack of users - archival methods historical data. Old computer systems - see how they work and see what could be useful

6 days or 6 hours? Simply want a 'flavour' of what users want - too short of a time to get anything in depth.
