Accessibility is often seen as only for disabled people, but in everyday life we can see how it affects people. If someone's driving a car, then they get a phone call they can't really pick it up and answer it - they would put themselves and others in danger. Therefore they'd need voice commands or something like that to answer the call. Here, the person isn't necessarily disabled but because of the environment, they'd need an alternate way of using their phone.

Combinatorial impairment is the combination of smaller impairments. It is often associated with old age, but often unfairly because it can affect everyone. (Regarding old age, experience and training matter much more than age)

What is the relationship between effective and accessible design? They go hand in hand, and are pretty much the same thing. No point in an effective design which is unaccessible and neither is an accessible one which is ineffective. 

5 main principles of efffective design (Foot-stool)
Facilitate:
- Perceivability
- Operability
- Openness
- Understandibility
- Flexibility

POUR:
Perceivable - can you see it
Operable - can you use it
Understandable - can you understand it
Robust - is it fault tolerant

How to facilitate perceivability:
- Are we only using a single channel to communicate things eg colour but without an alternate textual description
- Using meaningful names and labels for each interface component - including alts for icons
- Can the user personalise text fonts, colour, view size etc... (also flexibility)
