## Introduction

UX is widely adopted by HCI community, but doesn't have an agreed-upon definition.
A definition has some critical uses:
- help scientific discourse, especially between scientists from different disciplines - makes it easier to communicate when there is a common definition
- enable managing practical applications of UX, for which UX will need to be operationalised and evaluated against measurements.
- help the teaching of UX. a definition can provide the fundamental understanding of its nature and scope.

During the survey, ISO 9241 standards were being drafted. One of the tasks was to draft a definition UX.

## Survey results

275 respondents. 82 female, 137 male, 56 unknown. 25 countries:
- Finland (48)
- USA (43)
- UK (36)
- Netherlands (32)

For most, their primary interest in UX was to design better products.

The most agreed statements (first 3) are about the importance of users' internal states and context for UX (3, 5), as well as its temporal nature (8).

The next 3 agreed that UX should be grounded in current UCD (User Centred Design) (18), and further emphasise the temporal (23) and subjectivity (11) aspects of UX.

The next statements are mild/strong disagreements, such as the idea that UX is a just new term for an existing concept i.e. UX = HCI (21) or just a marketing ploy (4). Though subjectivity is valued by the respondents, over-subjectivity (9) is disagreed.

### Background variables vs agreement levels
It was found that that are variables about the respondents that may have affected how they answered the survey.
The higher the expertise in UCD and or UX, the less they agreed on the subjective nature of UX. People who have expertise in these fields are likely to be aware of common characteristics in product requirements and will gain similar experiences across different projects. This may then make UX less subjective to them.

Another thing that people with UX expertise agreed less on was the need for a defintion. This may imply that a concrete definition would benefit the non-experts for communication purposes.

### 5 Definitions

Industry favoured D1/D2, academia D2/D3. 

As for thoughts on what a definition should look like:
- 2 most mentioned uses were "identify all the important factors to be studied" and "enable the general public to be studied"
- This matches the most frequent characteristics "easy to understand, simple, clear, concise"

Temporal - In this case its about when UX is brought about - before, during or after interacting with a interacting with a system.
"it \[UX\] involves reflecting past and anticipating future at the same time"
"subsequent reflection on experience after the initial emotion has subsided"

Framework - "UX should be understood through the conceptual lens of a community of practice, which iterative defines constructs germane to UX via its activities such as designing and critiquing objects of interest."

Elements - Elements of the UX definition should be well defined. Measurable aspects such as physiological responses and user task performances - the traditional metrics of usability are considered relevant. "Subjective, psychological constructs like passion, type of affects, and consumer perception" are also relevant. Context in the definition for whom and where it is supposed to be used is important.
