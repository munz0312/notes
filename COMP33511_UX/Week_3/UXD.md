User Experience Design is concerned with the look and feel of an interface - graphic/visual design. Whilst UX is a broad term that concerns all aspects of a user's interactive with a product, UXD is the process of designing the visual user experience.

It is still the job of a UXDer to create products that are not only functional but also enjoyable, intuitive and engaging to use. They use research techniques and common design principles to design interfaces that meet user needs.

Visual design is only just one part of UXD - research, design, evaluation are needed too. It uses typography, colour, imagery and other visual elements to create an good looking UI that appeals to users whilst communicating a clear (brand) message. Graphic design is focused on creating graphics/images to convey information or messages.

## Design Systems & Languages

A collection of guidelines, components, and assets that are used to create and maintain a consistent and cohesive visual and interactive experience across different products, platforms and channels.

They serve as a single source of truth for design, ensuring a unified and efficient design process.

They establish a consistent visual language to ensure consistency across applications and platforms. These can include reusable components such as buttons, forms, navmenus, cards.

Another part of a design system are design principles which could cover topics like accessibility, responsiveness, layout, and content hierarchy. Additionally they document guidelines and rules for using the system, serving as a reference for designers and devs.

## Interaction Design

This is a subfield of UX design that focuses on designing how users interact with a product or service. It involves designing the flow of user interactions, defining how they navigate through a product/service. This includes placement and behaviour of the elements of the interface such as buttons, menus, forms as well as transitions between screens and feedback when users interact with the product.

## Zero UI & Conversational Interfaces

Zero UI are UIs that require very little to no user interaction to operate. No visible controls such as buttons, instead using other input methods such as voice, facial and gesture recognisation to interpret what the user wants to do and carry out actions. Examples include Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.

Conversational UIs are a subset of Zero UIs that use natural language - think of voice assistants (like the ones mentioned) - to enable communication between humans and machines. These interfaces are designed to emulate human conversation, providing a more intuitive interactive experience. A more recent example would be AI chatbots. Users simply use natural language to make requests, and these chat bots are (increasingly) able to do several different actions.
