Therefore to find an equilibrium, just go through each outcome to find if it is simultaneously a row minimum and a column maximum.

We maximise the column because these are the moves that Player 1 can make, given that Player 2 has chosen this column. Conversely, we minimise the row because these payoffs represent Player 2's choices given that Player 1 has chosen this row.
In the camping example, for Player 1 (Amelia), we calculated $max_i min_j a_{i,j}$, maximise the worst-case (lowest) payoff
In the camping example, for Player 2 (Scottie), we calculated $min_j max_j a_{i,j}$, minimise Player 1's best-case (highest) payoff
