 A strategy s is dominated by strategy s' if:
 - For all choices by other players
 - Payoff from s is less than or equal to payoff from s'

So if s is dominated, rational players (players who play optimally) will never play it.

Sufficient to check against pure strategies, and it also applies to mixed strategies.

Player 2's Strategy 3 is dominated by strategy 1 because for every row it has a smaller payoff (Player 2 wants to minimise).
