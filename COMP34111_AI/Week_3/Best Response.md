Suppose we know what strategies all other players will use.

For Player 1, given that Player 2 plays $s_2$, player 3 plays $s_3$ , player i plays $s_i$,

Player 1's best strategy $s^{*}_{1}$ is the best response if for all strategies $s_1$ :

$p_1$($s^{*}_{1}$, $s_2$ ... $s_i$) $\ge$ $p_1$($s_{1}$, $s_2$ ... $s_i$) 

There may be multiple best responses.

We can combine this with "For all strategies $s_2$, ... , $s_i$ for Players 2, ... , i respectively" to find the best response in all possible situations. (These rarely exist though)

In games with chance, payoff functions now represent the expected payoff, rather than the definite outcome. 

## Nash Equilibrium

### Formal Definition

If a player, Player $i$,changes their strategy (unilateral deviation), their payoff will worsen, because everyone else is playing their best strategy.

This creates stability. Deviating from best response results in a lower payoff.

Consider Scottie's responses from Amelia's perspective.
![[Pasted image 20251016153514.png]]

For Amelia to maximise the altitude, she should pick road 3 because, she can guarantee altitude 3 as Scottie's options only lead to $\ge$ 3 . If she goes for road 1, Scottie can just pick road 4 to get p=1. If she goes for road 2, Scottie can just pick 1 or 2 to get p=2.

Therefore, if Amelia doesn't pick 3, the altitude will decrease (if Scottie plays his best response).

 For Scottie to minimise the altitude, he should pick road 2, because then the best response that Amelia can choose is road 3 (p=3) because the other roads only get her altitude 2.

If Scottie picks 1, Amelia will pick 1 (p=7). If S picks 3, A picks 1 (p=5). If S picks 4, A picks 4 (p=6).

Therefore if he doesn't pick 2, as mentioned, the altitude will increase which is worse for him (as long as Amelia plays her best response).

There is an equilibrium, when Scottie plays 2, and Amelia plays 3 for an altitude of 3. These are their best responses.
