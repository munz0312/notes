What equilibria can arise, and what properties may they have
![[Pasted image 20251021085559.png]]
Here there are two equilibria, (1,2) and (2,1)
Each player prefers one of them
But (2,2) offers payoff of 10 to both, but they can't communicate with each other

*From Fred's perspective, if Joe talks, then he should also talk since 8 years is better than 10. From Joe's perspective, if Fred talks, then he should also talk for the same reason (Talk, Talk is the equilibrium point)*
Individually, its rational to talk, if they both talk they both get 8 years in jail.
If they both don't talk, they only get 2. Equilibrium does not give the best collective outcome. Individual rationality leads to collection irrationality.
Rational self-interest leads both to confess, resulting in worse outcome than mutual cooperation.

Another similar situation. Everyone would have been better off if they ALL went with C, but some chose to D to take advantage of the Cs. 
Alternative solutions:
1. System-level analysis: Look at stable states for populations of agents  
2. Regret minimization: Focus on difference between actual and optimal payoff  
3. Negotiation: Allow agents to communicate and coordinate
